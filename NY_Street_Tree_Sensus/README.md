# NYC Street Tree Census (2015) - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Welcome to the **NYC Street Tree Census EDA** project ‚Äî an in-depth exploration of New York City‚Äôs urban forest based on the 2015 Street Tree Census. This analysis reveals the structure, diversity, and health of over 600,000 recorded trees across the five boroughs, offering insights into environmental sustainability, urban planning, and community stewardship.

## üì¶ What‚Äôs Inside?

- **Project Overview:** A look at the dataset, its significance, and the key questions explored.
- **Data Preparation:** Cleaning and transforming raw census data to enable a structured analysis, including handling null values and standardizing columns.
- **Exploratory Analysis:**
  - **Borough-Wise Tree Distribution:** Understanding how trees are distributed across boroughs and what that reveals about green equity.
  - **Species Diversity:** Analyzing species frequency and the ecological implications of tree variety.
  - **Health & Stewardship:** Exploring tree health and the role of stewards in maintenance across species and locations.
  - **Visual Storytelling:** Insightful visualizations created using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for clear narrative and interpretation.
- **Key Insights:** Strategic takeaways and environmental implications from observed patterns.
- **Future Work:** Suggestions for further research, predictive modeling, and integration with environmental datasets (e.g., pollution or heat maps).

## üîç Impactful Insights

- **Borough Analysis:** Manhattan had the fewest trees, while Queens showed the highest number‚Äîprompting questions about urban planning and green space allocation.
- **Species Dominance:** A small number of species account for a large portion of total trees, highlighting potential biodiversity risks.
- **Health Patterns:** Tree health is affected by both species and borough, with community stewardship showing a strong correlation to improved health outcomes.
- **Environmental Responsibility:** The importance of local stewardship is evident‚Äîmore care generally equals healthier trees.

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

The NYC Street Tree Census provides an incredible window into urban ecological health. Key conclusions include:

- **Uneven Distribution:** Not all boroughs enjoy the same density of trees, reflecting disparities in green infrastructure.
- **Biodiversity Concerns:** Over-reliance on a few tree species can create vulnerabilities to disease and climate change.
- **Community Engagement Matters:** Tree health outcomes improve with local stewardship‚Äîemphasizing the need for inclusive civic participation.
- **Sustainability Insight:** EDA of tree data offers actionable knowledge for city planning, sustainability goals, and public health initiatives.

This project demonstrates how public data, when properly analyzed, can drive positive change. Future directions could involve integrating weather patterns, pollution data, and machine learning models to predict tree decline or optimize tree planting initiatives.
