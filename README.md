# Exploratory Data Analysis Monorepo

Welcome to the **Exploratory Data Analysis Monorepo** – a centralized repository that contains a collection of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) projects. This monorepo is designed to showcase various data analysis techniques, visualizations, and insights across multiple datasets.

## About

This repository serves as a portfolio of EDA projects demonstrating skills in data exploration, statistical analysis, and visualization. Each project is organized into its own subdirectory containing Jupyter notebooks and accompanying documentation (README files).

## Topics Covered

- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Techniques for handling missing values, data normalization, and transformation.
- **Data Visualization:** Interactive plots, charts, and dashboards using libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Exploratory techniques to uncover patterns, correlations, and trends.
- **Machine Learning Insights:** Preliminary explorations for supervised and unsupervised learning tasks.
- **Big Data Exploration:** Analysis of larger datasets using optimized libraries and efficient computation techniques.

## Repository Structure

Each project folder contains:

- **Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb):** Interactive documents that combine code, visualizations, and narrative text.
- **README.md:** Project-specific documentation describing objectives, methods, and results.
- **Datasets (Optional):** Sample datasets used in the analysis (if applicable).

## Contributing

- Contributions to enhance or add new EDA projects are welcome! To contribute:

  1. Fork this repository.
  2. Create a new branch for your project or improvements.
  3. Add your project folder (or update an existing one) with the necessary notebooks and documentation.
  4. Open a pull request with a detailed description of your changes.

Please follow the repository’s code style and documentation guidelines.
