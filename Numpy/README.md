# ðŸ“˜ NumPy

This folder contains Jupyter notebooks that cover key concepts in NumPy:

- **Basics**  
    - What is NumPy and why it matters
    - Installation and setup
    - Array creation from lists and using built-in functions
    - Element-wise operations and broadcasting
    - Indexing and slicing
    - Useful array functions (e.g., `sum`, `mean`, `reshape`)
    - Practical examples like normalization, matrix operations
    - Best practices and tips

- **Advance**  
    - Shape manipulation: `reshape`, `flatten`, `ravel`
    - Advanced indexing: integer, boolean, and conditional selection
    - Broadcasting mechanics
    - Linear algebra with `np.linalg`
    - Structured arrays for mixed data types
    - Vectorization vs loops (performance insights)
    - Random number generation and sampling
    - Aggregations with axes
    - Applied example: Z-score normalization

- **Exercises**

    **100 Numpy Exercises.ipynb**
    - A curated set of 100 exercises to practice and reinforce NumPy concepts
    - Covers beginner to advanced-level topics
    - Great for interviews and hands-on learning
